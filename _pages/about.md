Research Portfolio
---

I am a dedicated computer scientist and senior researcher with over eight years of experience at the intersection of cybersecurity, data analytics, and information systems. Currently a Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore, I lead advanced projects on vulnerability retrieval, graph-based attack modeling, and AI-driven threat intelligence. My work integrates machine learning, natural language processing, and graph algorithms to develop scalable solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges.

With a Ph.D. in Informatics and a history of impactful collaborations across academia and industry, I have authored peer-reviewed publications, patented methodologies, and received multiple awards, including the Länsförsäkringar Skaraborg Prize. My research vision focuses on enhancing cyber resilience, automating risk assessments, and bridging theoretical models with real-world applications.
