I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore, specializing in cybersecurity, data analytics, and information systems. With over eight years of research experience, I lead projects on vulnerability retrieval, graph-based attack modeling, and AI-driven threat intelligence.


## Research

> *Research Interests*: 1. Cybersecurity (*Vulnerability Analysis, Cyber Resilience, Threat Intelligence*); 2. Machine Learning (*Natural Language Processing, AI for Security, Graph Algorithms*); 3. Games in Cybersecurity.


My research focuses on developing AI-powered frameworks to automate risk assessments and enhance cyber resilience. Recent work includes graph-based attack modeling and mapping to MIRRE TTPs (üï∏Ô∏è) [<sup>[1]</sup>](./publication/2024-multi-step-attack-detection), model-based risk analysis (ü§ñ) [<sup>[2]</sup>](./publication/2024-enterprise-architecture-cybersecurity)[<sup>[3]</sup>](./publication/2023-model-based-cybersecurity)[<sup>[4]</sup>](./publication/2024-digital-twin-cybersecurity), enhanced vulnerability retrieval [<sup>[5]</sup>](./publication/2021-data-inconsistency-vulnerability)[<sup>[6]</sup>](./publication/2019-cps-security-database), patch strategy optimization through dependency-aware computing rules and game-theoretic approaches. I also explore domain-specific adaptations for NLP, ML and LLMs to tackle complex cybersecurity challenges, such as vulnerability assessment [<sup>[7]</sup>](./publication/2022-automatic-vulnerability-assessment)[<sup>[8]</sup>](./publication/2021-selective-ensemble-cybersecurity)[<sup>[9]</sup>](./publication/2020-automatic-vulnerability-severity).

I hold a Ph.D. in Informatics and have collaborated extensively across academia and industry, with a thesis on [Vulnerability Analysis for Critical Infrastructrures](https://github.com/Yuning-J/yuning-j.github.io/blob/master/files/PhDThesis-YuningJiang-0901.pdf). My contributions include peer-reviewed publications, patented methodologies, and multiple awards, such as the L√§nsf√∂rs√§kringar Skaraborg Prize.
