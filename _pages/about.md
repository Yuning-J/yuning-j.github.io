## Research

> *Research Interests*: 1. Cybersecurity (*Vulnerability Analysis, Cyber Resilience, Threat Intelligence*); 2. Data Analytics (*Graph Algorithms, Risk Modeling, Data-Driven Automation*); 3. Machine Learning (*Natural Language Processing, AI for Security, Graph Neural Networks*).


My research focuses on developing AI-powered frameworks to automate risk assessments and enhance cyber resilience. Recent work includes graph-based attack modeling (üï∏Ô∏è) and AI-driven threat detection (ü§ñ). I also explore domain-specific adaptations for natural language processing and machine learning to tackle complex cybersecurity challenges.

I hold a Ph.D. in Informatics and have collaborated extensively across academia and industry. My contributions include peer-reviewed publications, patented methodologies, and multiple awards, such as the L√§nsf√∂rs√§kringar Skaraborg Prize.
