title: "MITRE ATT&CK Application in Threat Intelligence and The Way Forward"
collection: publications
category: preprint
permalink: /publication/2024-mitre-survey
excerpt: "This paper analyzes 417 peer-reviewed publications to synthesize research on ATT&CK’s application across domains. We identify common adversarial TTPs and examine how NLP and ML enhance threat detection and response. We also explore ATT&CK’s interoperability with frameworks like the Cyber Kill Chain, NIST guidelines, and STRIDE. Finally, we evaluate ATT&CK’s effectiveness, validation methods, and sector-specific challenges, particularly in ICS and healthcare."
