title: "A Survey on Vulnerability Prioritization: Taxonomy, Metrics, and Research Challenges"
collection: publications
category: preprint
permalink: /publication/2025-patch-prioritization-sok
excerpt: " This paper reviews 82 studies and proposes a new taxonomy categorizing metrics into severity, exploitability, contextual factors, predictive indicators, and aggregation methods. Our analysis highlights gaps in existing approaches and challenges in multi-domain applicability. We emphasize the need for dynamic, context-aware metrics and scalable solutions, providing a comprehensive framework for vulnerability prioritization."
