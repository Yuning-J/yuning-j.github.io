title: "MITRE ATT&CK Application in Threat Intelligence and The Way Forward"
collection: publications
category: preprint
permalink: /publication/2025-mitre-survey
excerpt: "This paper synthesizes research on its application across these domains by analyzing 417 peer-reviewed publications. We identify commonly used adversarial TTPs and examine the integration of NLP and ML with ATT&CK to improve threat detection and response. Additionally, we explore the interoperability of ATT&CK with other frameworks, such as the Cyber Kill Chain, NIST guidelines, and STRIDE, highlighting its versatility. The paper further evaluates the framework from multiple perspectives, including its effectiveness, validation methods, and sector-specific challenges, particularly in ICS and healthcare."
