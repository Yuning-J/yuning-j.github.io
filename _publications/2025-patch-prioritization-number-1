title: "VulRG: Multi-Level Explainable Vulnerability Patch Ranking for Complex Systems Using Graphs"
collection: publications
category: preprint
permalink: /publication/2025-patch-prioritization
excerpt: "This work proposes a graph-based framework for vulnerability patch prioritization that integrates diverse data and risk metrics into a scalable model. It combines a network communication graph to identify critical attack paths and a system dependency graph to model risk propagation across components. The framework enables detailed risk assessments at the component, asset, and system levels, achieving superior accuracy and explainability in patch ranking compared to state-of-the-art methods."
